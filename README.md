Projectile Trajectory Calculator
Overview
This project is a comprehensive tool that calculates and visualizes the trajectory of a projectile. It leverages Pythonâ€™s special methods and encapsulation, providing an educational demonstration of object-oriented programming principles. The program computes the displacement and coordinates of a projectile based on its initial speed, height, and angle of projection, and then visualizes this data in a graph.

Features
Encapsulation: The use of Python's __slots__ and private attributes to ensure encapsulation and memory efficiency.

Special Methods: Implementation of special methods such as __init__, __str__, and __repr__ to provide a robust structure and readable output.

Mathematical Calculations: Accurate calculation of projectile displacement and vertical position using kinematic equations.

Graphical Representation: A visual representation of the projectile's trajectory using ASCII art, including x and y axes.

Utility Function: A utility function, projectile_helper, to easily input parameters and visualize the results.

This project is a great example of integrating physics with programming. It's not only educational but also a fun way to see how object-oriented programming concepts can be applied to solve real-world problems.
